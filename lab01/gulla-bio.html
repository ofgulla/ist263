            Olivia Gulla
            My major is Accounting, and my minor is Information Management & Technology. I am interested in doing taxes for a Public Company.
            I am Microsoft Excel Certified and have worked the past two summers as an Intern at Raytheon Technologies.
            My hobbies outside of work are running, reading, and cooking.
